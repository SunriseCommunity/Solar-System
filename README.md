Monorepo with all services to run instance of Sunrise server

## Description 📖

Solar System is a **monorepo** containing all the essential components required to run a complete Sunrise server stack. Each major piece is managed as a submodule within this repository, allowing you to orchestrate, develop, and deploy everything together with ease.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/)
- [**Docker** and **Docker Compose**](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
- Basic knowledge of command line operations

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository with submodules:**

   ```console
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/SunriseCommunity/Solar-System.git
   cd Solar-System
   ```

   Or if you've already cloned without submodules:

   ```console
   git submodule update --init --recursive --remote
   ```

2. **Set up configuration files:**
   
   Create copies of the example configuration files:
   
   ```console
   cp .env.example .env
   cp Sunrise.Config.Production.json.example Sunrise.Config.Production.json
   ```
   
   Fill in the required parameters in both files.
   
  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Make sure to edit `WEB_DOMAIN=` in `.env` to your actual domain that you plan to host on.
   
  > [!TIP]
  > You can customize the configuration files to match your requirements. For example, in `Sunrise.Config.Production.json`, you can change the bot username:
  > ```json
  > "Bot": {
  >   "Username": "Sunshine Bot",
  >   ...
  > }
  > ```

3. **Generate API keys:**
   
   Generate the token secret for Sunrise API requests:
   
   ```console
   chmod +x lib/scripts/generate-api-sunrise-key.sh
   ./lib/scripts/generate-api-sunrise-key.sh
   ```

   This will generate a token secret for the Sunrise API requests.
   
   Generate the Observatory API key (allows Sunrise to request Observatory without internal rate limits):
   
   ```console
   chmod +x lib/scripts/generate-observatory-api-key.sh
   ./lib/scripts/generate-observatory-api-key.sh
   ```
   
  > [!TIP]
  > You will be prompted to run multiple `.sh` scripts during setup, if you are using **Windows**, please use `.bat` equivalent scripts located in the same folder.
   

4. **Start the server:**
   
   ```console
   chmod +x ./start.sh
   ./start.sh
   ```
   
   This should start the server without any problems.

5. **Verify the server is running:**
   
   You can check that all containers are running with:
   
   ```console
   docker ps
   ```
   
   You should see containers for Sunrise server, Sunset website, Observatory, Sunshine Discord bot, and supporting services (PostgreSQL, Redis, Grafana, etc.) all running.

### Hosting to the Internet 🌐

To make your server accessible on the internet:

1. **Configure DNS records:**
   
   Make sure you have DNS records pointing the following subdomains to your server's IP address:
   
   - `*` (wildcard)
   - `api`
   - `osu`
   - `a`
   - `c`
   - `assets`
   - `cho`
   - `c4`
   - `b`
   - `grafana`
   
   These subdomains are required for the server to function properly.

2. **Start Caddy reverse proxy:**
   
   For simplicity, we use Caddy as a reverse proxy. By default, the `Caddyfile` is configured to host the website, server, and Grafana. You can uncomment additional configurations in the `Caddyfile` if needed.

   Start Caddy by running:
   
   ```console
   sudo caddy start --envfile .env
   ```
   
   Your server should now be up and accessible!

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > If you are intending to use **Grafana** for monitoring, make sure to uncomment the Grafana section in the `Caddyfile` before starting Caddy.
  > After starting Caddy, make sure to visit `grafana.*` subdomain and change the default password for the admin account!
